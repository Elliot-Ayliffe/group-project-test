st.write("&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervised learning,also known as supervised learning or supervised learning,is a method in machine learning that can learn or establish a pattern (function/learning model) from training data and use this pattern to infer new instances.The training data consists of input objects (usually vectors) and expected outputs. The output of the function can be a continuous value (referred to as regression analysis) or the prediction of a classification label (known as classification).")
st.write("&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of a supervised learner is to predict the output of this function for any possible input after observing some pre-labeled training examples (inputs and expected outputs). To achieve this, the learner must generalize from the existing data to unobserved cases in a reasonable manner (see inductive bias). In human and animal perception, this is commonly referred to as concept learning.")

    "Linear Regression": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear regression is one of the most fundamental supervised learning algorithms, primarily used for predicting continuous target variables. It assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable and attempts to find the best-fitting line to describe this relationship.",
    "Logistic Regression": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logistic regression is mainly used for binary classification problems. It maps the results of linear regression to values between 0 and 1 using a logistic function, thereby predicting the probability of an event occurring.",
    "Support Vector Machine": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful classification algorithm that maximizes the margin between different classes by finding an optimal decision boundary. SVM can also be used for regression problems.",
    "Random Forest": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that improves the generalization ability of the model by constructing multiple decision trees and averaging or voting on their results."
